FRCComponents
=============
 
 DXF/CDR vector drawings of FRC electircal parts for rapid prototyping electrical boards. The goal is to be able to quickly toss a masonite/acrylic on the laser cutter and build an electrical board. 
 
 Includes:
 
  * cRio
  
  * Victor
  
  * Digital Side Car
  
  * Power Board
  
  * Inverter
  
  * Power Switch
  
  * RaspberryPi
  
  * Spike Relay

  * Router DAP-1522 D-link router 4.4” x 5.7” x 1.3”, need mounting holes.

Mount Points and Pass-Thru Holes
===========================

Pass through hole dxf files for

* Mounting Brackets (TBD)

* Cable ties / wire mounts for regular 0.35x0.25 inch holes one inch apart (like this  ||  )

* Battery connector 1.6x0.8 inches

* Anderson Connector pass trough. 0.8x0.5 inches (should handle two).

* PWM 3pin connectors 0.5 inches square (for multiple connections)

* 18inch x 24inch board model for layout

Mounting Bolts and Nuts
===============================
It would be helpful to have bolt dimensions to get everything mounted flush. We can put that info here. 

* CRio
* Digital Side Car
* Power Distribution Board
* Power Switch
* Inverter
* Victor 
* RPi
